## 🧪 Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing

### 🎯 Goal:
Evaluate the performance of **trial store layouts** compared to control stores to determine if they should be rolled out more widely.

- Select appropriate control stores:
  - Define a metric (e.g., correlation or magnitude distance)
  - Match each trial store to a similar control store.
- Assess the performance:
  - Total sales revenue
  - Number of purchasing customers
  - Avg. transactions per customer
- Compare pre-trial and trial periods:
  - Determine whether uplift is statistically significant
  - Identify whether uplift was driven by new customers or increased purchasing
- Visualize results and summarize insights.

### 📌 Outcome:
Recommend whether the new layouts should be rolled out to similar stores.
